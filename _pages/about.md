I'm currently a Master's student in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences program at Columbia University. My research interests are in immigration, social inequality, discrimination, misinformation, quantitative methods, and experiment design.

***Evaluation of neural network-based heterogeneous treatment effect estimation methods in survey experiments*** \[[Report](https://github.com/DuYanji/dragonnet-performance-evaluation/raw/main/Evaluation%20of%20neural%20network-based%20heterogeneous%20treatment%20effect%20estimation%20methods%20in%20survey%20experiments.pdf)\]
* Evaluated performance and reliability of Dragonnet, a novel neural network-based architecture, in the domain of heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation using (1) simulation studies and (2) survey experiment data. 
* Results were promising: Dragonnet outperformed established methods (Bayesian Additive Regression Trees) in simulation studies and were comparable in predictions of causal effects in an empirical welfare attitude experiment.
* Keywords: `Neural Networks`, `Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART)`, `Causal Inference`, `Machine Learning`, `Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE)`


***An Investigation of U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Rates as a Political Issue*** \[[Report](https://github.com/DuYanji/covid-19-politics/raw/main/An%20Investigation%20of%20U.S.%20COVID-19%20Vaccination%20Rates%20as%20a%20Political%20Issue.pdf)\]
* Statistical investigation of COVID-19 U.S. vaccination rates as a political issue using county-level CDC and 2020/2016 U.S. election voting data.
* Keywords: `Regression Analysis`

***An NLP Analysis of Yelp Reviews during COVID-19*** \[[Report](https://github.com/DuYanji/duyanji.github.io/raw/master/files/GR5067_Group1_FinalReport.pdf)\] \[[Slides](https://github.com/DuYanji/duyanji.github.io/raw/master/files/GR5067_Group15_FinalSlides.pdf)\] 
* Analysis of Yelp reviews during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods included text processing, sentiment analysis (VADER; TextBlob), topic modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
* Keywords: `NLP`, `Python`, `Machine Learning`, `COVID-19`

***UN SDG Indicator Proxies*** \[[Report](https://github.com/DuYanji/duyanji.github.io/raw/master/files/SDG_ProxyIndicators.Blog.docx.pdf)\] \[[Slides](https://github.com/DuYanji/duyanji.github.io/raw/master/files/UN_SDG_Indicator_Proxies.pptx.pdf)\]
* Using theory-based approach to propose staple food prices as a measurable and real-time proxy indicator for undernourishment to  provide timely insight to the progress of UN SDGs in Indonesia.
* Keywords: `United Nations`, `Sustainable Development Goals`, `Prevelance of Undernourishment`, `Staple Food Price`, `Indonesia`

***Using Text Analysis of World News Headlines to Predict Stock Market Movement*** \[[Report](https://github.com/DuYanji/duyanji.github.io/raw/master/files/daily-news-stock-market-prediction.pdf)\] 
* Text analysis of world news headlines to predict stock market movement. Empirical investigation of ML model performance on datasets where the number of dimensions is far greater than the number of observations ( p >> n ). 
* Keywords: `Python`, `Machine Learning`, `Text Analysis`
