I'm currently a Master's student in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences program at Columbia University. My research interests are in immigration, social inequality, discrimination, misinformation, quantitative methods, and experiment design.

***Evaluation of neural network-based heterogeneous treatment effect estimation methods in survey experiments*** \[[Report](https://github.com/DuYanji/dragonnet-performance-evaluation/raw/main/Evaluation%20of%20neural%20network-based%20heterogeneous%20treatment%20effect%20estimation%20methods%20in%20survey%20experiments.pdf)\]
* Evaluated performance and reliability of [Dragonnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02120), a novel neural network-based architecture, in the domain of heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation using (1) simulation studies and (2) survey experiment data. 
* Results were promising: Dragonnet outperformed established methods ([Bayesian Additive Regression Trees](http://www.donaldgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BART-Green-Kern-POQ-2012.pdf)) in simulation studies and were comparable in predictions of causal effects in an empirical welfare attitude experiment.
* Keywords: `Neural Networks`, `Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART)`, `Causal Inference`, `Machine Learning`, `Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE)`

***A Brief Overview of Male Group’s Social Status Change over the Professional Career Lifecycle of Ballet Dancers*** \[[Report](https://github.com/DuYanji/reactions-critiques/blob/main/YanjiDu_Male%20Group%20Ballet%20Dancer%20Social%20Status%20Change.pdf)\]
* In this reaction memo, we will try to answer why female dancers are dominated at the early stages of their careers, but unable to grow into higher-status
positions. 
* First, we discussed a scenario where no discrimination exists and true capabilities are observable. Female dance professionals as minorities persist in
statistically sticky disadvantages. 
* Second, we used the Polya urn schema to model the growing disadvantages of females as the minority group. And we introduced Casella’s
“Role model” and Rivera’s “Cultural Matching” theories to interpret the mechanism. 
* In the end, we integrated the Polya urn schema in a social hierarchy framework.
* Keywords: `Social status`, `Role model effect`, `Polya urn`, `Cultural matching`

***Critique of “Priming COVID-19 Salience Increases Prejudice and Discriminatory Intent against Asians and Hispanics.” (Lu et al., 2021)*** \[[Report](https://github.com/DuYanji/reactions-critiques/blob/main/YanjiDu_Critique_Priming%20COVID-19%20Salience%20Increases%20Prejudice%20and%20Discriminatory%20Intent%20against%20Asians%20and%20Hispanics.pdf)\]
* Paper summary and critique of [Lu, Yao, Neeraj Kaushal, Xiaoning Huang, and S. Michael Gaddis, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2105125118). 

***An Investigation of U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Rates as a Political Issue*** \[[Report](https://github.com/DuYanji/covid-19-politics/raw/main/An%20Investigation%20of%20U.S.%20COVID-19%20Vaccination%20Rates%20as%20a%20Political%20Issue.pdf)\]
* Statistical investigation of COVID-19 U.S. vaccination rates as a political issue using county-level CDC and 2020/2016 U.S. election voting data.
* Keywords: `Regression Analysis`

***An NLP Analysis of Yelp Reviews during COVID-19*** \[[Report](https://github.com/DuYanji/duyanji.github.io/raw/master/files/GR5067_Group1_FinalReport.pdf)\] \[[Slides](https://github.com/DuYanji/duyanji.github.io/raw/master/files/GR5067_Group15_FinalSlides.pdf)\] 
* Analysis of Yelp reviews during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods included text processing, sentiment analysis (VADER; TextBlob), topic modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
* Keywords: `NLP`, `Python`, `Machine Learning`, `COVID-19`

***UN SDG Indicator Proxies*** \[[Report](https://github.com/DuYanji/duyanji.github.io/raw/master/files/SDG_ProxyIndicators.Blog.docx.pdf)\] \[[Slides](https://github.com/DuYanji/duyanji.github.io/raw/master/files/UN%20SDG%20Indicator%20Proxies.pptx.pdf)\]
* Using theory-based approach to propose staple food prices as a measurable and real-time proxy indicator for undernourishment to  provide timely insight to the progress of UN SDGs in Indonesia.
* Keywords: `United Nations`, `Sustainable Development Goals`, `Prevelance of Undernourishment`, `Staple Food Price`, `Indonesia`

***Using Text Analysis of World News Headlines to Predict Stock Market Movement*** \[[Report](https://github.com/DuYanji/duyanji.github.io/raw/master/files/daily-news-stock-market-prediction.pdf)\]
