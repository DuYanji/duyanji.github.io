I'm a data scientist currently studying at the University of Washington. Right now, I'm working on an investigation of semi-supervised image classification tasks within a [Federated Learning](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html) framework, in sponsorship with Brendan McMahan's group at Google AI. 

I'm interested in the intersection of machine learning, impactful analytics, and strategic planning. I have experience in data science and analytics in the technology and healthcare industries.
