I'm a data scientist currently studying at the University of Washington. I'm interested in the intersection of machine learning, impactful analytics, and product strategy. Right now, I'm working on an investigation of semi-supervised image classification tasks within a [Federated Learning](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html) framework, in sponsorship with Brendan McMahan's group at Google AI.
